Hi! I'm Harry and I'm currently working on projects, online courses and exploring my hobbies and interests.

- I'm interested in machine learning and full-stack software engineering.
- I have previously worked for 2 years as a Data Scientist at [Yordas Digital](https://www.yordasgroup.com/).
- I studied BSc Computer Science (First Class) and MSc Data Science (Distinction) at Lancaster University.
- During my second year at Lancaster University I created and sold a [full-stack time management application](https://www.ca-tms.com/) to a large architecture firm as a side project, which is currently being used by over 60 employees on a daily basis.
- I like keeping up-to-date with the latest developments in AI research.
- I'm a lifelong learner looking for opportunities to grow and improve my skills.

## Tech üíª

My current setup is:

- 14-inch MacBook Pro 2023, M2 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD
- NuPhy Halo 65 mechanical keyboard (first choice)
- Logitech MX Mechanical Mini keyboard (second choice)
- Logitech MX Master 3 mouse
- iPhone 14 Pro Max
- Apple Watch Series 6 (for general smartwatch use)
- iPad Pro 11-inch 2nd gen (for taking handwritten notes and an extension of my MacBook screen)
- Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro 11-inch
- Apple Pencil (for taking handwritten notes on iPad Pro)
- AirPods Pro 1st Gen (for podcasts, audiobooks and study music)
- Sony WH1000XM3 headphones (for general music)

## Productivity ‚úèÔ∏è

Having tried every productivity app under the sun, I've finally settled on the following setup:

- Notion (for my second brain, I follow [Tiago Forte's PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/))
- Things3 (for daily tasks, habits and miscellaneous todos)
- Obsidian (for note taking and research)
- Drafts (for quick notes)
- Fantastical (for planning events and runs)
- Readwise (for automatically syncing tweets and highlights to Notion)
- Instapaper (for quickly saving online content to read later)
- GoodNotes (for taking hand-written notes on iPad)
- Grammarly (for spell-checking and general language checks for blog posts)

## Running üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My current gear is the following:

- Garmin Forerunner 255 (for recording runs)
- Garmin Running Dynamics Pod (for advanced data tracking during runs)
- Apple Watch Series 6 (yes, I do wear 2 watches!)
- AirPods Pro 1st Gen (for music)
- Asics Novablast 3 (for training runs)
- Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 (for races and parkruns)
- Hoposo Massage Gun (for recovery and pre-workout)

I create custom workouts for all my runs on a Sunday for the following week using the calendar in Garmin Connect. The runs can then be synced to the Garmin Forerunner to make starting preset workouts much faster. I record treadmill and outdoor runs on the Garmin which, once saved, upload activity data to Garmin Connect and Strava automatically. I do parkrun most weekends depending on my training routine. Follow me on Strava if you're into running!
